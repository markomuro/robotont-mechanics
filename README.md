# robotont-mechanics
Here is the latest release of the Robotont.

This repository is maintained by Renno Raudm√§e renno.raudmae@ut.ee
If you want to make modifications on Robotont and you think that it would be cool if it is available 
for the others as well, then let me know.

Main development is so far done in SolidEdge ST10 - academic version.

Production files are also available in STEP either in STL.
